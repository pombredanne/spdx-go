GO SPDX Parser Library
======================

> **Note:** This is a work in progress. The above features and usage are just what is planned for the initial release.


Parser library for SPDX written in Go (golang). It includes a CLI tool that will have features such as convert, validate and format (pretty-print).

The CLI tool is a good example on how to use the /spdx, /tag and /rdf packages in other Go programs. All the features available in the CLI tool are available in the library as well.

Features (planned for first release)
------------------------------------
- SPDX 1.2 (the only version supported at the moment)
- parsing RDF formats using [goraptor][goraptor].
- Convert to/from rdf and tag formats

The following are currently done:
- Validate SPDX documents
- HTML validation output (use the -html flag)
- Auto-detect the input format (file extension or first line guessing)
- Format (pretty-print) SPDX documents (tag format)


Downloading and installing
--------------------------

> Currently, `github.com/vladvelici/spdx-go` is used as the import
> path for the packages in the code. This will change in the future
> to the SPDX official repositories.

The easiest way is by using `go get`:

    go get github.com/vladvelici/spdx-go

This downloads and installs the spdx-go tool and library.

Dependencies
------------

* [libraptor2][raptor] for parsing and serializing RDF
* @deltamobile/goraptor fork of [goraptor][goraptor] by [William Waites][ww]

Building and testing
--------------------

Simple as `go build` and `go test`.

The code is available in two repositories:

1. Official repository at http://git.spdx.org/spdx-tools-go.git
2. Mirrored on GitHub at https://github.com/vladvelici/spdx-go
